input column changes:
    standardizing inj_mbar, bias_v, bias_i, extraction_i leads to best loss seen so far
    standardizing everything is better than default
    standardizing inj_mbar, bias_v, bias_i, extraction_i
        leads to significantly better loss, so I think some vars are useless
    standardizing inj_mbar, bias_v, bias_i, extraction_i, k18_fw, k18_ref, g28_fw, puller_i
    standardizing inj_mbar, bias_v, bias_i, extraction_i, k18_fw, k18_ref, g28_fw, puller_i, inj_i, ext_i, mid_i, sext_i, x_ray_source, x_ray_exit
        restricting to just these variables is pretty good

run 2 is bad likely because it is out of distribution 
run 7 is bad likely because the beam wasn't running well that day
    I manually inspected the error and the MAP is approximately the same error as the others, but the MAPE is signigicantly higher therefore I believe the real fcv1_i values are very low

TODO:
    how do we weigh the variables
